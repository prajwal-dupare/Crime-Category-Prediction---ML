# Crime Category Prediction

This repository presents a project from IIT Madras which is mandatory as a part of data science degree based on machine learning pipeline to predict crime categories using rich city-level crime data. By analyzing patterns across time, location, and demographics, the project aims to support public safety and inform law enforcement strategies.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Given a dataset containing detailed information about various criminal incidents, including:

* **Date & Time**
* **Location (coordinates/neighborhood)**
* **Victim Demographics (age, gender, race)**
* **Crime Descriptions**

🎯 **Objective**: Build a machine learning model that predicts the **crime category** for a given incident.
